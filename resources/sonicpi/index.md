### Sonic Pi

Sonic Pi is a live coding environment based on Ruby, originally designed to support both computing and music lessons in schools, developed by Sam Aaron in the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory in collaboration with Raspberry Pi Foundation.

#### What to bring
Students attending the Sonic Pi session should bring a Windows, Mac, or Linux laptop and a set of headphones. Chromebooks cannot be used for this session. We will have a couple of laptops available to loan out, but students will need to provide their own headphones. Also if you have access to a small portable battery powered speaker, bring that with you as well.

#### Getting Started  
We recommend the following resources to get started with Sonic Pi:

Students should be comfortable with typing - either touch typing or hunt-and-peck typing is fine. 
Sites such as typing.com and keybr.com are great free online resources that teach typing skills.
