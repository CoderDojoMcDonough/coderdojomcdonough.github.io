### Project idea: Solar Eclipse Visualization

**Platform:** 3D Modeling with Blender

**System Requirements:** Windows or Mac laptop. See mentor for a USB thumb drive with Blender installation program.

**Goal:** Create a 3D visualization of the solar eclipse using Blender.

**Outline:**

Add a light source on the right hand side of the screen to represent the shining sun.
Add a sphere representing the earth on the left hand side.
Add a sphere representing the moon in the middle.  Animate the mood slowly between the sun and the earth to demonstrate the moon casting a shadow on the earth.

**Extra credit:**
* Figure out how to put a sphere around the sun's light source. The sphere should allow the light source to pass through.
* Map a texture on the earth sphere or paint the sphere to make it look more like the earth.
* See if you can somehow make the scale of the visualization accurate.
