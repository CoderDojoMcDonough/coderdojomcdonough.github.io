# A bit of history

## In the beginning...

CoderDojo was initially started by James Whelton in early 2011\. He set up a computer club at his school where he started teaching basic HTML and CSS. Later that year he met Bill Liao, an entrepreneur and philanthropist, who was interested in growing the project into something bigger than just an after-school computer club.



## The Dojo is born...

In July 2011 the first CoderDojo was launched at the National Software Centre in Cork, Ireland. The first sessions were immensely popular. This encouraged rapid growth, initially across Ireland and then globally in North America and beyond. Through making the movement open source, thousands of dedicated coders set up more Dojos across the world, making the CoderDojo movement a global phenomenon. There are now more than 1,100 verified Dojos in 63 countries, with new Dojos starting almost every day. CoderDojo McDonough was founded in 2014.
