## The Dojo is born...

In July 2011 the first CoderDojo was launched at the National Software Centre in Cork, Ireland. The first sessions were immensely popular. This encouraged rapid growth, initially across Ireland and then globally in North America and beyond. Through making the movement open source, thousands of dedicated coders set up more Dojos across the world, making the CoderDojo movement a global phenomenon. There are now more than 1,100 verified Dojos in 63 countries, with new Dojos starting almost every day. CoderDojo McDonough was founded in 2014.
